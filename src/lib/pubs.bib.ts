  abstract     = {Stereochemical editing strategies have recently enabled the transformation of readily accessible substrates into rare and valuable products. Typically, site selectivity is achieved by minimizing kinetic complexity by using protecting groups to suppress reactivity at undesired sites (substrate control) or by using catalysts with tailored shapes to drive reactivity at the desired site (catalyst control). We propose “network control,” a contrasting paradigm that exploits hidden interactions between rate constants to greatly amplify modest intrinsic biases and enable precise multisite editing. When network control is applied to the photochemical isomerization of hexoses, six of the eight possible diastereomers can be selectively obtained. The amplification effect can be viewed as a mesoscale phenomenon between the limiting regimes of kinetic control in simple chemical systems and metabolic regulation in complex biological systems. Chemists typically aim to optimize a single reaction pathway to a desired product. Isomerization of complex molecules poses a challenge to this approach because tweaking one portion of the molecule can influence the sensitivity of others in the vicinity, leading to multiple competing processes. Carder et al. meticulously mapped out the rates of photo-driven stereoisomerization among the hexose sugars. By better understanding the full network of reactivity, they could then tune reaction times and catalyst design to select for particular isomers across the complex landscape. —Jake S. Yeston},

  abstract     = {Amino acids are essential building blocks in biology and chemistry. Whereas nature relies on a small number of amino acid structures, chemists desire access to a vast range of structurally diverse analogues1-3. The selective modification of amino acid side-chain residues represents an efficient strategy to access non-canonical derivatives of value in chemistry and biology. While semisynthetic methods leveraging the functional groups found in polar and aromatic amino acids have been extensively explored, highly selective and general approaches to transform unactivated C-H bonds in aliphatic amino acids remain less developed4,5. Here we disclose a stepwise dehydrogenative method to convert aliphatic amino acids into structurally diverse analogues. The key to the success of this approach lies in the development of a selective catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation method driven by photochemical irradiation, which provides access to terminal alkene intermediates for downstream functionalization. Overall, this strategy enables the rapid synthesis of new amino acid building blocks and suggests possibilities for the late-stage modification of more complex oligopeptides.},

  abstract     = {Breast cancer metastasis is the major cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Early detection would save many lives, but current fluorescence imaging probes are limited in their detection ability, particularly of bone and liver micrometastases. Herein, probes that are capable of imaging tiny (<1 mm) micrometastases in the liver, lung, pancreas, kidneys, and bone, that have disseminated from the primary site, are reported. The influence of the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chain length on the performance of water-soluble, pH-responsive, near-infrared 4,4′-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene (BODIPY) probes is systematically investigated to demonstrate that PEG tuning can provide control over micrometastasis tracking with high tumor-to-background contrast (up to 12/1). Optimized probes can effectively visualize tumor boundaries and successfully detect micrometastases with diameters <1 mm. The bone-metastasis-targeting ability of these probes is further enhanced by covalent functionalization with bisphosphonate. This improved detection of both bone and liver micrometastases (<2 mm) with excellent tumor-to-normal contrast (5.2/1). A versatile method is thus introduced to directly synthesize modular water-soluble probes with broad potential utility. Through a single intravenous injection, these materials can image micrometastases in multiple organs with spatiotemporal resolution. They thus hold promise for metastasis diagnosis, image-guided surgery, and theranostic PEGylated drug therapies.},

We found that increasing the ratio of fluorinated to non-fluorinated monomers led to substantial improvements in both crystallinity and porosity. Computational models suggest that this improvement might be explained by a substantial energetic stabilization in the face-to-face stacking interaction of the fluorinated COF monomers."}
